### Project 1 : Simon Says

### Proposal:

This game is based on the classic game of Simon Says. The game will be a score based game. In the home page, there will be four squares with colors of red, yellow, green and blue(which will light up in a random pattern). As the player will click on the start button the user will follow the pattern of lights and sounds for as long as they can. When the user matches the correct pattern of lights and sounds, they will proceed to the next round and their score will be incremented through each round. If the user is unable to match the correct pattern, the game will end.

### Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

*	User should also get an option in the start if they want to play the game with or without the sound.
* The pattern speed will increase with each round.
